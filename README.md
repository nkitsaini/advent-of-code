# Advent of Code
Here is my solution code for Advent of Code 2022 and 2023.

- Code is not optimized for speed unless required
- Code is not optimized for readability
- As of now the code is not cleaned after submission. So you'll see different print statements and commented codes here and there.
- I might comment the code once AoC ends, to explain my thought process around different decisions
- Most of the times the solution of part-2 is also written in file for part-1.

# Directory structure
For 2022 it is very messed up. For 2023, you can find data files and code in `2023/day1`, `2023/day2` and similar.
